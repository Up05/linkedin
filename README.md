My markdown blog files for Linkedin. Currently in Markdown format.

Finished blogs:
1. about-me.md
2. ulang.md
3. computer-optimisation-techniques-applied-to-you.md

`about-me.md` just lists my experience in this field.

`ulang.md` is a much more technical description of a programming language interpreter I wrote in autumn.

`computer-optimisation-techniques-applied-to-you.md` is a much less technical and instead more interesting blog where I compare software optimisation techniques and real life work strategies. This blog also has the least formal writing style, but that seems to be okay for Linkedin posts.
