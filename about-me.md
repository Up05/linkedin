I am a programmer. It's hard for me to be more specific in that, since I have, more or less, the same amount of experience in quite a few fields, like: parsers and interpreters, graphical and command-line tools, game dev and website development. This is, most likely, just because I often make small -- weekend -- projects, and have only a couple larger ones. Plus, I have only been coding for 5 years or so and as a beginner there just isn't that architecture intuition to be able to make anything bigger before it devolves into spaghetti.

Now, to be more specific, of parsers, I have made: an HTML parser, a TOML parser (which is also my most tested project), and my own interpreted programming language in Java, which, I will cover in more detail in another blog. I've gotten up to a parser on my "to-be compiled" programming language in C. Although, this specialization seems to be very rare in the job market, it has been very addicting to me, the problems are familiar, but also unique, there are easy wins, but also issues to lose sleep over. And the problem space is also so pure (until you need foreign functions).

As far as various tools are concerned, this is what I have the most experience with, although there is also a lot to know here... I am pretty sure, that as of the time of writing, I have used Java for my programs the longest, but I should have most programs written in Odin. Simply because things that used to take me a week or a month, like: WallpaperTODO2, ClipEditor or img_to_ascii now takes me a weekend. For my graphical interfaces, I used to use almost exclusively use Swing, although, I have tried JavaFX, Compose, web views and I have also dabbled in just the raw Windows CreateWindowA... API in my C++ phase. Although, nowadays I just roll my own basic GUIs with Raylib, since it is packaged with Odin, and I have also been recently enjoying SDL. 

Game development was where I, and I assume many others, have started, I used to make small games and code doodles on the web with the extraordinarily simple p5js library. This is where I made, Prediction Game -- where you scroll mouse over ships, so they sink and the difficult part is for your CPU to blur the canvas, because p5.blur()... Also Deck Game (don't let the water through), Round Game (you're a gravitational object avoiding asteroids) and a bunch of other small ones. After p5, I just went straight to OpenGL (I never want to make games in a tool, that is slow at base speed), I made an, actually, relatively fun game in Java with LWJGL and remade it in C with GLFW & OpenGL. Also, the funny thing about C Asteroids is that, the vector class of that game was the moment I fell in love with C. You just make a function and call it. And that's it. There is no Vector interface or rays that extend vectors... If you try to do that, the compiler just goes ahead and slaps you. It enforces simplicity. Until you get addicted to macros... Which, well, I am now making foreach, Array<T> and tagged unions in C... But anyways, the past few years, I have been making native games with Raylib. I have made my own tetris, Fireworks (where a pyrotechnic deflects cannonballs to save his duke) and Video Game 13 (a 3D boss shooter, I slogged through over a week). So, I guess, now that I think about it, nothing has changed... 

# Languages I Have Used

I am pretty sure, that my most used language is still Java and my biggest project is, somehow, still a Minecraft mod that I mostly finished maybe 4 years ago, but did not really go anywhere... And well Java is still one of my favorites, although, I feel, I may be the only person to enjoy it for how comfy it is... As stated earlier, I have also written a few graphical and command-line tools, as well as games in Java.

Now, my favorite language is easily Odin. At least, as of writing, it's a very rare language, but, if you can imagine all the best parts of Go and C, well Odin is not far off. The syntax is as simple as it can reasonably be, the build system is: `odin run .`. Libraries are directories and the compiler is packaged with Raylib, SDL, OpenGL, Vulkan and many other "annoying to include C++ libraries". Anyone can just read the source code to most everything in the language (I came to Odin from C++, Rust and JavaScript...). I could go on about what makes this such a lovely language to me, but for the sake of brevity, Odin is also my second my used language, easily.

Kotlin is something that I have used, me and a couple of my friends were making an MMORPG Minecraft server with it. And, actually, for that purpose, Kotlin is not that bad,
because, Java does not have first-class support for array programming and also does not have operator overloading, which is something I apreciated really quite a lot, while writing
a particle rendering system. And what's even nicer, is that you can tack methods onto other classes, so I did not have to make my own Vector class, instead, I could just use Spigot's Vector and Location and JOML's Vector3D classes. Otherwise, for that project, I remember, that I wanted to die after using their sum types. For everything else, for one reason or another, 
I just feel bad using it. I find Compose, to be relatively difficult to understand (obviously, due to my lack of experience with it).  I dislike that casting is so strict, i.e.: the type system is so strong. The `!!` is very distracting to me, when I'm trying to quickly prototype some algorithm. I guess, Kotlin is to Java in the same way C++ is to C to me... (I use C)

I also have some experience in C++. I had a relatively brief period of it being my favorite language. That was when I only knew JavaScript, Java and C++. At the time of writting this blog, I do not even believe it to be superior to C.

Now then, C. C is still easily my favorite language (in theory). _If I may make the reference_, This is How it FEELS to Use C: I make something, I am proud of it. I run it. The compiler gives me a backhanded slap and calls me stupid or the CPU just pouts and ignores me. Then I learn how computers work... OR. I remember something that I learned before and I become the happiest person in the world with my little cryptic macro. The thing I do dislike about it, is the unstandardized project structure and dynamic link libraries. And also, in practice, I find that Odin just kind of adds the things, that I am missing. And Odin, Go and Java do not allow me to make macros, which makes me forget just how fun it is to make them... 

I have done some less-than-commendable things with Go (although, I did report one of my "add-ons", since the exploit I found was easily fixable)... And I am also currently writting a backend for a fast online drawing board with Go. But I have used it. I like it quite a lot. Networking just worksâ„¢. I don't feel like it just wastes performance. It is very similar to Odin (my favorite language), so I feel relatively comfortable in it. 

I have used Rust for small tools or foreign libraries, but I don't enjoy writing Rust, which, I'm sure, is just due to my lack of experience in it, because my main problem with it is, that the language does not allow the things I expect to be able to do. Especially with multithreading, "Like, oh my god, it's fine!" saw a record-breaking performance the rankings of things I have said a lot.

I used to use Unity when I was learning to code and I recently used C# for a mobile app, until I tried to run it on my phone (which was by the end). Otherwise, I like the extra freedom when compared to Java, and I especially, love the very recent `dotnet run`. But between Java, Go and C, I just haven't had a reason to use it.

I am also, relatively comfortable in many scripting languages, so, since I've been using Linux for the last year, I have written many shell scripts, I used to use PowerShell and CMD. Although, on Windows, I genuinely, just see no reason to ever use PowerShell or CMD over Python, Go, Perl, even C (just any programming language) for scripting...

I have also, recently, used R for some plotting over data. I enjoyed the language itself a whole lot, but, I never managed to draw anything on screen (I didn't use rstudio) and I also never got ggplot2 to draw anything onto an image, which sucks a lot. Apart from that, I love the array indexing, like: `my_table2d[[the_row]]` or `my_vector[myvector %not_in% c("a", "b", "c")]`, and the nice standard library: `responses <- read.csv("data.csv"); png("diagram.png", width=600, height=400, bg="white"); ...; dev.off()` and also, the surprisingly massive amount of mutable things...

And I, obviously, know a bit of Python and a hell of a lot of JavaScript, because, who doesn't? 
Except, for the 1 in 10 Americans, who think that HTML is a sexually transmitted disease, I guess.

# Tools I have used

I have been using Linux for about a year or so. On my laptop from 2011, I installed CachyOS (a derivative of Arch Linux, that was, supposedly, faster) and more recently on my main machine I simply just use Arch. I have used Debian,
but, from my experience, the package manager just introduced more problems for me to deal with. And I have also installed NixOS, but I quickly understood that that was not for me... But, by now, I am relatively comfortable with Bash scripting, systemd, ssh, nginx, virtual machines, and, I guess, reading documentation...

Before Linux, I spent my time trying to get as close to a good tiling window manager on Windows 10 as possible... I have had many iterations, like: AHK scripts at the start, then I tried to make my own C implementation, but there was just no documentation for things I needed (eventually even my one example went away). I also used AquaSnap, which was relatively nice. And then by the end, GlazeWM augmented with AHK. But it still just never felt good. And Besides that, I could never get the terminal to be nice, because the paths in Windows are just awful! Half my configuration files are in `~/.config`, the other half in `C:/Users/me/AppData/?/...`. Neovim did not work well in any of the terminals.

Another tool, I use often use is git. I have had a few open-source contributors to my projects. Because of my laptop, I have learned to avoid Github's web UI and just use the command line to interface with it. I, like everyone, sometimes need to merge files that only I work on... It is pretty obvious to me how to `git bisect` and why I **should** squash commits.

As for code editors. My current one and my favorite one is Neovim. Vim motions are genuinely amazing and I do not see how I could ever, willingly, switch from modal editing. I also, use IntelliJ for Java and Kotlin, because, the LSP is just so good. I used to use Visual Studio Code as my general editor, Visual Studio & Code::Blocks for C++ & I have tried a bunch of lesser-known editors, like the Focus editor. 

Since I did not mention these in the languages section, I am still comfortable with LaTeX, I wrote my high school math "roundup" with LaTeX. I love Typst and use it for every document I can. I might as well mention, that I know Microsoft Word, Markdown and HTML(I consider HTML to be a document format, I am sorry).
