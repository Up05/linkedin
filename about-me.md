I am a programmer. It's hard for me to be more specific in that, since I have, more or less, the same amount of experience in quite a few fields, like: parsers and interpreters, command-line tools, gamedev and website development. Likely, this thin spread is just because I have only been coding for around 5 years and I have made many smaller projects instead of a single massive one.





I am a programmer. And, well, it's hard to be more specific than that, since I've written command-line and graphical tools, web sites and servers, various markup and configuration file parsers and programming language interpreters, as well as games and game mods.

For a while now, I have been obsessed with parsers, i.e.: text understanding tools, ones that convert string to in-memory data structures. Over the last summer I wrote a TOML parser (TOML is often used for software configuration/settings), since then I have written an interpreter for my own programming language: ulang, a parser for, what will most likely be, a compiled C alternative programming language for myself an HTML parser and many other tiny parsers for one-off scripting languages, like: the one for generating UML activity diagrams.

Apart from that, if I'm unable to almost immediately find a piece of software that I want

Also, since the start of my first year in college (as of writting, the first year is about to end), I've been using and in love with Linux on my 12 year old Intel Xeon laptop. Over the last summer I started using Vim motions, I have since almost fully switched to Neovim, which is an absolutely awesome tool in so many ways. Then, in the autumn, I started using CachyOS (a derivative of Arch Linux, but with a, supposedly, faster kernel and libraries), now, I would install Void Linux or plain Arch, since I don't like many of the provided things (e.g.: the indirection in fish's config), but it was absolutely lovely as a learning experience, since the partially preconfigured system let me learn tools, like x..., i3, dunst, rofi, coreutils, etc. one by one. 

Linux on my old laptop is also where my exploration for great software really got going (or at least so it feels). When using Windows, there are many things that both suck and aren't meant to be interchangeable, e.g.: the search bar, file explorer, dwm(Desktop Window Manager), I mean, it is very possible to use Flow, dolphin and GlazeWM, but Flow doesn't come up half the time, GlazeWM cannot be used with the Windows key (whick AHK fails to solve in another quirky way) and only recently has Microsoft introduced `winget`, but, at least for me, it feels slow as hell, so I still often use `choco` or install software (very virus prone) or just use portable versions of software (very virus prone).    ...



# Programming languages 

I am pretty sure, that my most used language is still Java and my biggest project is somehow still a Minecraft mod and I mostly wrote maybe 4 years ago and did not really go anywhere... And well Java is still one of my favourites, although, I feel, I may be the only person to enjoy it for how comfy it is... In the same vein, I know Kotlin relatively well, from when we were writting a small collection of big Minecraft mods with my friend. Kotlin is somewhat hard to talk about for me, since I don't like it purely emotionally. Basically, ever since I got into C, I fully and always expect to be able to transmutate any blob of data into any type of equivalent size. Kotlin does not, what so ever, allow me to do this and I feel hurt. This has also happened to me in Rust, although, there is no chance that there isn't a work-around to the Rust's strong type system.

I also have some experience in C++, I had a relatively brief period of it being my favourite language. That was when I only knew JavaScript, Java and C++. It is not my favourite language right now. Actually, I do not even believe it to be superior over C.
